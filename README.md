Google Spreadsheets API
========================
A simple Python wrapper for the Google Spreadsheeta API.
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yoavaviram/python-google-spreadsheet.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yoavaviram/python-google-spreadsheet)



Features
--------

* An object oriented interface for Worksheets
* Supports List Feed view of spreadsheet rows, represented as dictionaries
* Compatible with Google App Engine


Requirements
--------------
Before you get started, make sure you have:

* Installed [Gdata](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/) (pip install gdata)

Usage
-----

List Spreadsheets and Worksheets:

     >>> from google_spreadsheet.api import SpreadsheetAPI
     >>> api = SpreadsheetAPI(GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_USER, GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_PASSWORD, GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_SOURCE)
     >>> spreadsheets = api.list_spreadsheets()
     >>> spreadsheets
     [('MyFirstSpreadsheet', 'tkZQWzwHEjKTWFFCAgw'), ('MySecondSpreadsheet', 't5I-ZPGdXjTrjMefHcg'), ('MyThirdSpreadsheet', 't0heCWhzCmm9Y-GTTM_Q')]
     >>> worksheets = spreadsheet.list_worksheets(spreadsheets[0][1])
     >>> worksheets
     [('MyFirstWorksheet', 'od7'), ('MySecondWorksheet', 'od6'), ('MyThirdWorksheet', 'od4')]

Please note that in order to work with a Google Spreadsheet it must be accessible
to the user who's login credentials are provided. The `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_SOURCE`
argument is used by Google to identify your application and track API calls.

Working with a Worksheet:

    >>> sheet = spreadsheet.get_worksheet('tkZQWzwHEjKTWFFCAgw', 'od7')
    >>> rows = sheet.get_rows()
    >>> len(rows)
    18
    >>> row_to_update = rows[0]
    >>> row_to_update['name'] = 'New Name'
    >>> sheet.update_row(0, row_to_update)
    {'name': 'New Name'...}
    >>> row_to_insert = rows[0]
    >>> row_to_insert['name'] = 'Another Name'
    >>> sheet.insert_row(row_to_insert)
    {'name': 'Another Name'...}
    >>> sheet.delete_row(18)
    >>> sheet.delete_all_rows()

That's it.

For more information about these calls, please consult the [Google Spreadsheets
API Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/).

Tests
------
To run the test suite please follow these steps:

* Make sure [Nose](http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/) is installed: (`pip install nose`)
* Create a local file named: `test_settings.py` with the following variables set to the relevant values: `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_USER`, `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_PASSWORD`, `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_SOURCE`, `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_KEY`, `GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_KEY`
* Run `nosetests`
